# DevOps ProjectFor this project, please think about how you would architect a scalable and secure static web application in AWS or another IaaS provider.* Create and deploy a running instance of a web server using a configuration management tool of your choice. The web server should serve one page with the following content. ```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>  <head>    <title>Hello World</title>
  </head>  <body>    <h1>Hello World!</h1>  </body></html>```
* Secure this application and host such that only appropriate ports are publicly exposed and any http requests are redirected to https. This should be automated using a configuration management tool of your choice and you should feel free to use a self-signed certificate for the web server.* Develop and apply automated tests to validate the correctness of the server configuration.* Express everything in code and provide your code via a Git repository in GitHub.Be prepared to walk though your code, discuss your thought process, and talk through how you might monitor and scale this application. You should also be able to demo a running instance of the host.
